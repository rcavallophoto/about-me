  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I have a background in product and lifestyle photography. For the past six years I have been Production Artist for a large E-commerce retailer. I recently relocated from Southern California to Denver with my girlfriend Katie and Jack Russell Oliver.</p>
  <p>I strive on working with other creative and honest people. The best ideas and products come from team efforts.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
  <p>I grew up skateboarding, camping, fishing, and hiking. More recently I fell in love with the world of cycling, it’s a great way to commute to work or just discover new places around town that you couldn’t experience from a car.</p>
  <h4>What's your dream job</h4>
  <p>Previously, my dream job was to be an in-house photographer. That has changed to a front end developer so I can still be creative and eventually be able to work remotely.</p>
  <h4>What music have you been listening to?</h4>
  <p>Lately, I have been listening to Mac Demarco, Sonic Youth, and Yo la tengo.</p>
